        Fetal Health Predictor
    </h2>
    <p class=paragraph>
        Our team utilized fetal health data accessable from Kaggle (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification">link</a>) to create a machine learning model that 
        will predict the probable outcome of the health of a fetus based on user input 
        (<a href="https://github.com/Storkopolus/Final_Project1">source code</a>).

        The possible fetal health outcomes are:
        <br>
        1. Normal
        2. Suspect
        3. Pathological
        <br>
    </p>

    <p class=paragraph>
        The original fetal health dataframe started with 22 columns. Our goal was to
        narrow down to the most pertinent columns while still maintaining the highest
        possible accuracy.  We originally narrowed the dataframe down to 11 columns.
    </p>
    <p class=paragraph>
        We initially tested the model utilizing the following machine learning 
        algorithms in Jupyter notebook:
      <br>
        1. Logistic Regression
      <br>
        2. Linear Discrimination Analysis
      <br>
        3. K Neighbors Classifier
      <br>
        4. Random Forest Classifier
      <br>
        5. Decision Tree Classifier
      <br>
        6. Gaussian NB
      <br>
        7. Linear SVC
      <br>
      <br>
      We then plotted the algorithms to get a visual comparison.
      We can see below that the box and whisker plots are between 
      approximately 81% and 97% accuracy. As seen in the plot, 
      the Random Forest Classifier achieves the highest accuracy between
      about 90% and 97%.

      <br>
      <p class=paragraph>
        We continued to narrow down to create
        the least amount of columns with the highest accuracy above 90%.  
        We started with plotting all the columns to see which columns to drop.

        <br>
        We were able to narrow the dataframe down to 6 columns and maintain a
        predictability outcome of 93% accuracy.  
        After the group decided on the 6 inputs it was determined 
        that we needed to optimize the model, by tuning the parameters.  
        A random forest regressor was used to tune the following parameters: 
        n_estimators, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, max_features, max_depth, 
        and bootstrap.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Once the optimization was complete there was no increase in accuracy 
        and it stayed in the 93% range, which was close to the original 
        accuracy (94.6%) when all 11 inputs were used and no optimization was 
        utilized.  These optimized settings were then used when the machine 
        learning model was saved for import into the flask app.
